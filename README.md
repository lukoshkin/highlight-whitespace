# Trailing Whitespace

Hereinafter, I refer to my plugin as TrailingWS, and similar others â”€ as TWS.
<!-- 'and' is used here as 'while' -->

Why to create another TWS plugin?

1. TrailingWS leverages `matchadd` instead of `match`.
1. Trailing whitespace in markdown files is highlighted with a different color.
1. I was configuring my vimrc, I didn't know about existing plugins.

Let's talk about each point separately.

1. `match` function provides for creating just three matches (i.e., using
   `match`, `2match`, `3match`). Better not to occupy them, if one can achieve
   the same goals with `matchadd`.

1. Trailing whitespace in markdown files is not a bad thing but sometimes is a
   necessity. Thus, more mild colors than red should be used.

1. Don't do that. I was not going to create a new plugin, though I ended up
   writing it. Googling _trailing whitespace vim_ terminated on [the first link
   ](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Remove_unwanted_spaces). By the way, the
   mentioned there tips are just 'tips', as written.


## Installation

With [**Packer**](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use 'lukoshkin/trailing-whitespace'
```

With [**vim-plug**](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'lukoshkin/trailing-whitespace', { 'branch': 'vimscript' }
```


## Customization

Two ways to configure depending on the selected branch
<!-- Omitting a punctuation at the end emphasizes the direction of meaning -->

#### vimscript

Note you must specify both `ctermbg` and `guibg` values, even if you don't
care about one of them. <br> Specifying other than `bg` keys has no effect.

```vim
let g:tws_pattern = '\s\+$'
let g:tws_color_md = { 'ctermbg': 138, 'guibg': 'RosyBrown' }
let g:tws_color_any = { 'ctermbg': 211, 'guibg': 'PaleVioletRed' }
```

#### master (Lua)

For the Lua implementation, the functionality is a bit wider. <br> One can
specify a trailing whitespace color per filetype.

```lua
use {
   'lukoshkin/trailing-whitespace',
   config = function ()
      require'trailing-whitespace'.setup {
         pattern = '\\s\\+$',
         palette = { markdown = 'RosyBrown' },
         default_color = 'PaleVioletRed',
      }
   end
}
```
